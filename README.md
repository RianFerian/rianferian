Learning is a journey.

As data enthusiast I start my journey learning statistics at Bogor Agricultural University. 

At 2020 I join Bangkit Academy machine learning Boot Camp which led by Google, GoTo and Traveloka. 
I also join Baparekraf digital talent at 2021 for data analyst bootcamp.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Pt. PP. London Sumatra as Reporting and Analyst Assistant Operation Administration.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Django and PySpark for my next project.
